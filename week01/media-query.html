            <h2>1 Nephi 3:7</h2>
            <p>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, 
                for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that 
                they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.</p>

            <h2>Alma 5:46</h2>
            <p>Behold, I say unto you they are made known unto me by the Holy Spirit of God. Behold, 
                I have fasted and prayed many days that I might know these things of myself. And now I do know of myself 
                that they are true; for the Lord God hath made them manifest unto me by his Holy Spirit; and this is the 
                spirit of revelation which is in me.</p>
